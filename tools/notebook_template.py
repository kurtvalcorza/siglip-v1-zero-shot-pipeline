"""Per-repository template for tools/build_notebook.py (NOTEBOOK_SPEC 2.0 §4 standalone carrier).

Only the task-specific prose and stage cells live here. Runtime install, the embedded package (six
modules, carried verbatim in dependency order), and the model pin/stage/verify cells are produced by
the generator from repository sources so they cannot drift from the package.

Generator /2 keys in use: ``modules`` lists every module of ``src/siglip_v1_pipeline/`` except
``__init__.py``; ``entry_module`` is ``config.py`` (it holds ``MODEL_ID``/``MODEL_REVISION``/
``MODEL_LICENSE`` and the model key under the package's own spelling ``DEFAULT_MODEL_KEY``, mapped by
``identity_names``); ``rewrites`` carries two rules — the fleet ``DEFAULT_WEIGHTS_DIR`` rule and the
``__file__`` use inside ``model.resolve_weights_path`` (a repository-checkout convenience that a
standalone notebook has no checkout for); ``model_load`` lets the pipeline pick CUDA when it is visible
(the fine-tuning stage is where that matters; CPU is the documented fallback).

This template configures an E2E zero-shot-classification fine-tuning workflow: the pinned
google/siglip-base-patch16-256 snapshot is digest-verified and loaded, 360 CC0 iNaturalist photographs of
six bird species are fetched with per-file digests, validated and split by photograph, the drawn synthetic
shapes are classified through the inference contract, the frozen model's zero-shot accuracy / macro F1 /
text-to-image mAP over the held-out photographs is measured beside two non-neural baselines, a bounded
fine-tuning of the vision tower's last blocks runs in the kernel with SigLIP's sigmoid loss, the held-out
split is scored again per species, the adapted model re-scores the shapes, and the adapter is exported and
reloaded.

        "with an attention-pool head and a 12-layer text tower over a 32,000-piece English SentencePiece vocabulary, trained on the English pairs of WebLI with the sigmoid loss; 203,202,050 parameters, "
        "published under the **Apache-2.0** licence. A photograph and a prompt are scored by the cosine of their projected "
        "embeddings, scaled and shifted by the model's learned `logit_scale` and `logit_bias` and read through a sigmoid: the "
        "scores are independent per pair, **not calibrated probabilities**, **prompt/label dependent**, and the model never "
        "abstains — the highest-scoring label is returned whatever the image shows.\n\n"
        "What this notebook adds to inference is **adaptation with labelled photographs**. The dataset is real and where the "
        "frozen model has room to improve: 360 CC0-licensed, research-grade iNaturalist photographs of six common North "
        "American birds (**CC0 1.0**; four small sparrows, a junco and two finches, 60 per species, one per observer), pinned "

        "- **Runtime:** a fresh supported runtime (Google Colab or Jupyter, Python 3.12). The default path runs on CPU (float32) and uses CUDA automatically when available. CPU is slow but adequate: the build record measured about 7 s to embed and score the 96 test photographs and 181 s for the six epochs of fine-tuning (216 photographs per epoch through the full vision tower, the last two blocks and the head training), including the per-epoch validation scoring, so the whole default path is about three and a half minutes of model time on the build workstation's CPU with the snapshot and photographs already cached (a 2-vCPU hosted runtime will be several times slower); a hosted T4 finishes it in a few minutes. The pinned `torch==2.14.0` install and the 813 MB checkpoint are the large downloads of the run; the photographs add about 39 MB.",
        "- **Knowledge:** basic Python and PIL; what a sigmoid score and a cosine similarity are; what accuracy, macro F1 and average precision measure and why none is a human judgement; why a high score is not a correct label.",
        "- **Data contract:** records are `{id, image, label}` — a PIL image or a file decodable by Pillow with sides up to `MAX_IMAGE_SIDE` (4096) px and a label of at most 64 plain characters (the prompt is `DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` with the label, or its display name, filled in). Ids match `[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]{1,64}` and are unique; a dataset needs 8..20,000 records over 2..100 labels; splitting is stratified per label after pixel-digest de-duplication so no photograph lands in two splits. BYOD accepts one zip of images plus a `labels.csv` in that shape.",
        "- **Validation is structural, not semantic:** every image is opened and decoded and every label checked, but nothing checks that a label is right — a mislabelled set is fine-tuned on without complaint.",
        "- **Privacy:** Do not upload confidential or restricted data to a hosted runtime unless you are authorized to process it there. The default path uploads nothing.",
        "- **External access (data):** besides the model snapshot, the default path fetches 360 JPEG/PNG files from `https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/<id>/medium.<ext>` (about 39 MB in total), each pinned by byte size and SHA-256 in the carried `samples.py` and refused on any mismatch; every photograph's iNaturalist observation page and observer login are kept in its record.

        "The frozen model is already a usable zero-shot classifier on six bird species it was never told about — far above "
        "the two non-neural baselines — and a bounded fine-tuning of the vision tower's last two blocks and head on 216 "
        "photographs moves the retrieval view clearly (text-to-image mAP 0.72 → 0.89 in the build record) and the top-1 "
        "accuracy by eight photographs (0.76 → 0.84), with the gain concentrated on the species the prompt separated worst, "
        "and an 85 MB adapter that reloads to identical embeddings. That is the claim: the adaptation contract works end to "
        "end on a real labelled photograph set, and the numbers it produces are read on three metrics, per species, on two "
        "prompt sets, against two non-neural baselines and the frozen model rather than in isolation.\n\n"
        "The test split is 96 photographs from one seeded draw of one sample, the validation split that picks the epoch is 48, "
        "the metrics are three reference-based scores (own numpy implementations; none a human judgement), accuracy moves in "
        "steps of one photograph, and the build record's own epoch history shows the estimate's fragility: validation accuracy on the "
        "48 photographs moved between 0.71 and 0.85 from one epoch to the next. So a gain here says the "
        "contract works, not that the adapted model is better on your photographs, that its scores are calibrated, or that a "
        "sigmoid score is a probability of being right — it still returns a best label for every image, and it can be wrong "
        "confidently. Fine-tuning on a narrow set can also erode the model elsewhere; the drawn shapes re-scored in Section 9 "
        "are three images of evidence about that, not a measurement.\n\n"
        "Three things to carry to real data. **Baselines first:** the majority floor, the colour neighbour and the frozen "
        "model's score on *your* labels are the numbers to read before any adapted one, per class and on the retrieval view. "
        "**Leakage:** keep every photograph in one split (the contract de-duplicates by decoded pixels) and split by "
        "photographer or session when your images come from few sources — the sample's observer overlap is printed for exactly "
        "that reason. **Prompts:** the classifier is the prompt as much as the tower; a second prompt set is scored here so the "
        "difference is visible, and a label an annotator wrote is not a prompt the model understands.\n\n"
        "Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision's package, carried in this standalone notebook, can "
        "acquire and digest-verify the pinned model snapshot, fetch and digest-verify a real labelled photograph set, validate "
        "the demonstrated dataset contract without leakage, execute the inference contract and a bounded fine-tuning, evaluate "
        "against two trivial baselines and the frozen model on an image-disjoint split, and emit the shown machine-readable "
        "artifacts — without the repository being reachable. It does **not** establish benchmark superiority, zero-shot "
        "accuracy on any other population or camera, calibration, or production fitness.\n\n"
        "**Optional experiments (they do not affect the default path):** set `TRAINABLE_VISION_LAYERS = 4` and compare the "
        "artifact size and the held-out mAP; raise `EPOCHS` and watch the validation mAP pick the epoch while the training "
        "loss keeps falling; change `LEARNING_RATE` to `1e-5` and read a smaller, steadier gain; or bring your own photographs "
        "through BYOD and read the two baselines before the adapted number.\n\n"
